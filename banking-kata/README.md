## Description
Write a class Account that offers the following methods:
- `void deposit(int)` 
- `void withdraw(int)`
- `String printStatement()`

An example statement would be:

    Date        Amount  Balance
    24.12.2015    +500      500
    23.8.2016     -100      400

## Performance improvements
The application performance was verified using a JMH benchmark. After that a small refactoring was performed
and the performance improvement is obvious as shown on the images below (more = better).

After:

After improvement of the benchmark, different approach to synchronization while printing was verified once again
and a 20% performance improvement can be easily observed:

After:

## Additional requirements

### CSV file based account implementation âœ…
#### Performance comparison

### Statement returned as an HTML table ðŸ”œ

Example:

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Date</th>
            <th>Amount</th>
