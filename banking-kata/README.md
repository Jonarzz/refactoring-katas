    23.8.2016     -100      400

## Performance improvements
The application performance was verified using a JMH benchmark. After that a small refactoring was performed
and the performance improvement is obvious as shown on the images below (more = better).

Before:
![before](performance/first/before.PNG)
After:
![after](performance/first/after.PNG)

After improvement of the benchmark, different approach to synchronization while printing was verified once again
and a 20% performance improvement can be easily observed:

Before:
![before](performance/second/before.PNG)
After:
![after](performance/second/after.PNG)

## Additional requirements
- âœ… CSV file based account implementation
- ðŸ”œ statement returned as an HTML table
