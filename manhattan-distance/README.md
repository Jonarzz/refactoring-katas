# [Manhattan Distance kata](https://kata-log.rocks/manhattan-distance-kata)
## Requirements
[Manhattan distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_distance)
is the distance between two points in a grid 
(like the grid-like street geography of the New York borough of Manhattan) 
calculated by only taking a vertical and/or horizontal path.

Write a function `int manhattanDistance(Point, Point)` 
that returns the Manhattan Distance between the two points.

### Additional rules
* The class `Point` is immutable (its state cannot be changed after instantiation)
* The class `Point` has no getters
* The class `Point` has no public properties
(i.e. the internal state cannot be read from outside the class).
